# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common programming error in Java: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The provided code attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range, resulting in a runtime exception.  The solution shows how to correct the code by adjusting the loop condition to prevent accessing out-of-bounds indices.

**Bug:** The loop iterates one time too many, resulting in the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`

**Solution:** Modifying the loop condition resolves the issue, ensuring the loop stays within the valid array bounds.
